# jump

Tap the screen to make the pink blob jump and avoid the obstacles.  Similar to Chrome 404 dinosaur game, or Flappy Bird. The jump 'physics' seems produce the same flapping effect as Flappy Bird.

Many features could be added, for example:

* scoring, keep user's high score
* other obstacles, flying obstacles
* fix the collision detection algorithm, or use other shapes that are easier to detect a collision (hint: detecting if two circles collide; or if two rectangles collide, is easier)
* vary the ground height
* game speeds up during play
* drawing obstacles/components in different colors, perhaps with contrasting border
* draw blob differently when it jumps; replace blob with another character
* Alter jump algorithm for smoother jumping
* prevent user 'floating' by continuing to tap; make user return to the ground after a certain time airborne
* what else can you think of?
